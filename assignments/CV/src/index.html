            <p class="text-justify font-serif indent-2 p-2">Working in management and the optical industry for 10 years has provided me with a great deal of opportunities to learn skills and improve myself provding a great mix of people skills and technical learning. As someone who is highly motivated by learning I am now looking to transition into the tech sector which feels like a space that provides an almost limitless opportunity for acquiring new knowledge and skills. People always say no one can know everything, and they're right, but you can be sure I'm going to try and get as close to knowing everything as I can.</p><p class="text-justify indent-2 font-serif p-2"> I have recently undertaken a coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Pyhthon and have dedicated the majority of my time outside of work building on top of that having already created a small web app with python's flask framework on top of the work set by the course. I thrive when learning new skill and problem solving and pick things up at a quick pace.</p><p class="text-justify indent-2 font-serif p-2"> As a potential employee my background in optical retail has equiped me with the ability to work as part of a team in a fast paced enviroment to produce exceptional results. As a manager people have always been my focus putting the customer at the heart of practice as well as being focused on the development and wellbeing of the staff I have been responsible for. Decision making and problem solving are core aspects of my day to day and I believe my solutions focused approach allows me to deal with difficult and unexpected situations.</p><p class="text-justify indent-2 font-serif p-2"> Moving forward it is my desire to work for an employer that understands that above all else people matter; one that mirrors my focus on customer and employee.</p>
